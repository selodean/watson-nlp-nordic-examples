## 1. Language: Multi-lingual

'**Syntax-Entities-Keywords-Sentiment-Multilingual.ipynb**' is a very simple starter notebook that loads and runs pre-trained models included in Watson NLP: Syntax, machine-learned and rule-based Entities, Sentiment and Keywords. Simply change text_input and language code to your favorite language.

## 2. Language: Finnish (FI)

A Jupyter notebook and a dataset to run Watson NLP library models on Finnish text. You can easily adapt it to another language by changing a) the data set b) the language code in the names of the libraries.

'**Citizen-Feedback-Analysis-FI.ipynb**' analyses and visualizes Sentiment and Entities using as data source '**helsinki-feedback-data.csv**', and trains a Dictionary based extractor. 

The dataset consists of open data of Helsinki City feedback data downloaded from http://dev.hel.fi/apis/open311
